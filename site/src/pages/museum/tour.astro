  <p>Welcome to the Museum of Broken Things, a unique space dedicated to the beauty found in failure, imperfection, and the forgotten artifacts of everyday life. As you take your tour, you’ll journey through a curated collection of objects that once served a purpose but have since been retired, discarded, or damaged. The museum’s collection is divided into six fascinating sections:</p>
  
  <ul class="section-list">
    <li>1. containers</li>
    <li>2. dishes</li>
    <li>3. glass</li>
    <li>4. music</li>
    <li>5. technology</li>
    <li>6. sports</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Each area showcases objects that tell stories of use, wear, and breakage—some accidental, some inevitable—yet each one holds a special charm, revealing the delicate balance between utility and fragility.</p>

  <p>In the <cite>containers</cite> section, you'll find jars and bottles with missing lids or chipped rims, followed by the <cite>dishes</cite> collection, filled with cracked plates and cups worn down by years of service. Move on to the <cite>glass</cite> display, where delicate vases and windows show the art of shattered beauty, pieces held together or still suspended in their broken state. In the <cite>music</cite> section, you'll encounter old instruments—guitars with broken strings, record players with cracked turntables, each echoing the tunes they once played. Then there's <cite>technology</cite>, where relics of early innovations like analog radios and cassette players are lovingly preserved despite their flaws. The <cite>sports</cite> exhibit is equally engaging, with deflated basketballs, bent rackets, and well-worn gloves telling the tale of games long played.</p>
  
  <p>A highlight of your visit is the special event dedicated to <cite>early home computers</cite>. This exhibit brings together a remarkable collection of once-revolutionary machines from the 1970s and 1980s—computers that promised a future of limitless possibilities. Many now sit with broken screens, worn-out keyboards, or obsolete hardware, but each one marks a moment in technological history. Whether you're a nostalgic tech enthusiast or a curious newcomer, this event provides a fascinating glimpse into the dawn of personal computing and a reminder that even groundbreaking innovations eventually show their age.</p>
